Memory Storage: 

Each class instance is stored in memory as a contiguous block.
Each instance contains its data members and a pointer/reference to its class's methods (functions).
For Module and Lecture, memory allocation would include space for their respective data members and a reference to their methods.
Overriding:
Overriding refers to the ability of a subclass to provide a specific implementation of a method that is already provided by one of its superclasses.
In Java, when a method is invoked on an object, the JVM looks for the method in the class of the object's actual runtime type.
If the method is found in the subclass, the subclass's implementation is used; otherwise, the superclass's implementation is used.

The module object has a name attribute and pointers to the getName() and register() methods. The oose object has numberOfExercises attribute and a pointer to the getName() method.
